# Brain_tumor
Implementation of a program to detect if a person's got a tumor or not from an image of the scans with an accuracy of 87% on unknown validations sets.
I have used a convolutional neural network to solve the problem. 
The implementation uses tensorflow and keras. The file tumor.h5 is the trained model and can be used to directly classify the images. It can also be used to create a web based classifier.
